## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. The Problem
- What if I can‚Äôt find a reliable veterinarian nearby when I need one the most?  
- What if I forget my pet‚Äôs vaccination schedule?  
- What if emergency services are not available in time?  

Pet owners face significant challenges when trying to access veterinary care. Information about clinics is often scattered across social media, outdated websites, or word-of-mouth recommendations. This leads to wasted time, uncertainty about service quality, and limited transparency regarding pricing or specializations.

In preliminary interviews with pet owners:
- **60%** reported difficulties in comparing veterinary clinics.  
- **70%** expressed frustration over missing reminders for vaccines or regular check-ups.  

The lack of a centralized, user-friendly platform reveals both a gap in accessibility and a strategic opportunity to improve the pet healthcare experience.

## 3. Strategy

### 3.1. Value Proposition Canvas
How we aligned pet owners‚Äô needs with our solution

**Dual approach:**

- **For Pet Owners:**  
  Smart search and booking system, reminders for vaccinations, medical history tracking, and quick access to emergency care.  

- **For Veterinary Clinics:**  
  Management panel for appointments, patient history (with consent), promotional tools, and complete professional profiles with verified credentials.  

**Identified gaps:**

- **Social:**  
  Lack of trust in service quality due to scattered and unreliable information sources.  

- **Emotional:**  
  Stress during emergencies, uncertainty when choosing clinics, and frustration with forgotten medical tasks.  

- **Technical:**  
  Absence of an integrated, user-friendly platform that centralizes clinic information, offers real-time bookings, and automates reminders.

### 3.2. UX Person
Developed through interviews, these archetypes represent PetVet's key users. Each has unique motivations and barriers that were fundamental in defining the app's core functionalities.

üë•üîπ **Laura Gomez: The Busy Professional**
> "I need the app to remind me of everything, otherwise I'm sure I'll forget."

üë•üîπ **Andr√©s Torres: The First-Time Owner**
> "I want the app to be easy to use, because this is the first time I'm taking care of a cat."

üë•üîπ **Carmen Rodr√≠guez: The Multi-Pet Household Manager**
> "With so many animals, I need an app that helps me not get tangled up."

### 3.3. Benchmarking
To develop an application that truly meets the needs and expectations of pet owners seeking veterinary care, it was essential to analyze existing platforms‚Äîincluding both direct competitors and indirect references known for their efficient booking systems and user-friendly design.

The goal was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of current solutions, both functionally and visually, in order to incorporate best practices and avoid common pitfalls.

**Types of platforms analyzed:**
* üêæ **Direct Competitors (Telemedicine & Booking):** Platforms like `Vetster` and `BuddyVet`, which directly connect owners with vets for consultations and appointments.
* üè• **Clinic Directories & Management:** Services like `WhereVets`, `CuidaPet`, and `GVet`, which focus on finding clinics or managing patient information.
* üìÖ **Indirect References (Service Booking):** Apps like `Zocdoc` or `Booking.com`, valued for their powerful search filters, clear comparisons, and seamless booking experience.

## 5. Structure

### 5.1. Navigation Flow
The PetVet navigation flowchart outlines a task-oriented and clear structure designed to streamline the process of finding and booking veterinary care. After logging in, the app is built around three main sections:

- **Dual Veterinary Search:** Users can find clinics through an interactive `Map` or a filterable `List of veterinary clinics`.
- **Streamlined Booking Process:** Both search paths converge on a simple, step-by-step flow: `Select Veterinary` -> `Select Hour` -> `Select Pet`.
- **Pet & User Management:** A dedicated `Profiles` section allows users to modify their account, add new pets, and manage existing pet information.

The structure requires users to `Login` before accessing the main functionalities. This decision allows for a personalized experience from the start, such as having pet information readily available when booking.

## 6. Skeleton
### 6.1. Low-Fi Wireframes
These wireframes establish the architectural blueprint for the PetVet platform, focusing on the system's core functionalities as defined in our solution. The navigation is designed around a persistent bottom tab bar, ensuring that users can effortlessly switch between the main sections: searching for clinics, managing appointments, and viewing their pets' profiles.

In our initial design phase, the interfaces were structured around three key user journeys, derived directly from the primary needs of our UX Personas:

Veterinary Discovery and Comparison: Includes all screens dedicated to searching for clinics, applying filters (by location, ratings, etc.), comparing service options, and viewing detailed veterinary profiles.


Appointment Booking Flow: Encompasses the entire process from selecting a time slot on a clinic's schedule to confirming the appointment and receiving automated reminders.


Pet Health Management: Contains the interfaces for creating and managing individual pet profiles, tracking their medical history, and receiving notifications for upcoming vaccinations.

A comprehensive PDF document containing the complete set of initial wireframes with great detail for each view for quick comprehension and to avoid ambiguity, showing the main screens and user interactions defined during the initial design phase.

As the design evolved based on initial feedback, the "direct chat" feature was strategically deprioritized to concentrate on perfecting the core user experience. The focus shifted to strengthening the search and comparison tools and ensuring the appointment booking process was as seamless and intuitive as possible, directly addressing the main pain points identified in our research.
