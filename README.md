## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. The Problem
- What if I can‚Äôt find a reliable veterinarian nearby when I need one the most?  
- What if I forget my pet‚Äôs vaccination schedule?  
- What if emergency services are not available in time?  

Pet owners face significant challenges when trying to access veterinary care. Information about clinics is often scattered across social media, outdated websites, or word-of-mouth recommendations. This leads to wasted time, uncertainty about service quality, and limited transparency regarding pricing or specializations.

In preliminary interviews with pet owners:
- **60%** reported difficulties in comparing veterinary clinics.  
- **70%** expressed frustration over missing reminders for vaccines or regular check-ups.  

The lack of a centralized, user-friendly platform reveals both a gap in accessibility and a strategic opportunity to improve the pet healthcare experience.

## 3. Strategy

### 3.1. Value Proposition Canvas
How we aligned pet owners‚Äô needs with our solution

**Dual approach:**

- **For Pet Owners:**  
  Smart search and booking system, reminders for vaccinations, medical history tracking, and quick access to emergency care.  

- **For Veterinary Clinics:**  
  Management panel for appointments, patient history (with consent), promotional tools, and complete professional profiles with verified credentials.  

**Identified gaps:**

- **Social:**  
  Lack of trust in service quality due to scattered and unreliable information sources.  

- **Emotional:**  
  Stress during emergencies, uncertainty when choosing clinics, and frustration with forgotten medical tasks.  

- **Technical:**  
  Absence of an integrated, user-friendly platform that centralizes clinic information, offers real-time bookings, and automates reminders.

### 3.2. UX Person
Developed through interviews, these archetypes represent PetVet's key users. Each has unique motivations and barriers that were fundamental in defining the app's core functionalities.

üë•üîπ **Laura Gomez: The Busy Professional**
> "I need the app to remind me of everything, otherwise I'm sure I'll forget."

üë•üîπ **Andr√©s Torres: The First-Time Owner**
> "I want the app to be easy to use, because this is the first time I'm taking care of a cat."

üë•üîπ **Carmen Rodr√≠guez: The Multi-Pet Household Manager**
> "With so many animals, I need an app that helps me not get tangled up."

### 3.3. Benchmarking
To develop an application that truly meets the needs and expectations of pet owners seeking veterinary care, it was essential to analyze existing platforms‚Äîincluding both direct competitors and indirect references known for their efficient booking systems and user-friendly design.

The goal was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of current solutions, both functionally and visually, in order to incorporate best practices and avoid common pitfalls.

**Types of platforms analyzed:**
* üêæ **Direct Competitors (Telemedicine & Booking):** Platforms like `Vetster` and `BuddyVet`, which directly connect owners with vets for consultations and appointments.
* üè• **Clinic Directories & Management:** Services like `WhereVets`, `CuidaPet`, and `GVet`, which focus on finding clinics or managing patient information.
* üìÖ **Indirect References (Service Booking):** Apps like `Zocdoc` or `Booking.com`, valued for their powerful search filters, clear comparisons, and seamless booking experience.
