User Experience Design for PetVet: An Integrated Platform Connecting Pet Owners with Veterinary Services for Efficient Search, Comparison, and Appointment Booking.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. The Problem
- What if I can‚Äôt find a reliable veterinarian nearby when I need one the most?  
- What if I forget my pet‚Äôs vaccination schedule?  
- What if emergency services are not available in time?  

Pet owners face significant challenges when trying to access veterinary care. Information about clinics is often scattered across social media, outdated websites, or word-of-mouth recommendations. This leads to wasted time, uncertainty about service quality, and limited transparency regarding pricing or specializations.

In preliminary interviews with pet owners:
- **60%** reported difficulties in comparing veterinary clinics.  
- **70%** expressed frustration over missing reminders for vaccines or regular check-ups.  

The lack of a centralized, user-friendly platform reveals both a gap in accessibility and a strategic opportunity to improve the pet healthcare experience.

### 3.1. Value Proposition Canvas
How we aligned pet owners‚Äô needs with our solution

**Dual approach:**

- **For Pet Owners:**  
  Smart search and booking system, reminders for vaccinations, medical history tracking, and quick access to emergency care.  

- **For Veterinary Clinics:**  
  Management panel for appointments, patient history (with consent), promotional tools, and complete professional profiles with verified credentials.  

**Identified gaps:**

- **Social:**  
  Lack of trust in service quality due to scattered and unreliable information sources.  

- **Emotional:**  
  Stress during emergencies, uncertainty when choosing clinics, and frustration with forgotten medical tasks.  

- **Technical:**  
  Absence of an integrated, user-friendly platform that centralizes clinic information, offers real-time bookings, and automates reminders.
