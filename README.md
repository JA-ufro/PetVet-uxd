User Experience Design for PetVet: An Integrated Platform Connecting Pet Owners with Veterinary Services for Efficient Search, Comparison, and Appointment Booking.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. The Problem
- What if I can‚Äôt find a reliable veterinarian nearby when I need one the most?  
- What if I forget my pet‚Äôs vaccination schedule?  
- What if emergency services are not available in time?  

Pet owners face significant challenges when trying to access veterinary care. Information about clinics is often scattered across social media, outdated websites, or word-of-mouth recommendations. This leads to wasted time, uncertainty about service quality, and limited transparency regarding pricing or specializations.

In preliminary interviews with pet owners:
- **60%** reported difficulties in comparing veterinary clinics.  
- **70%** expressed frustration over missing reminders for vaccines or regular check-ups.  

The lack of a centralized, user-friendly platform reveals both a gap in accessibility and a strategic opportunity to improve the pet healthcare experience.
